# RSS News Aggregator

*Prepared as a Final Project for the Brainstation Web Development Full-Time Course.* 

The goal of this application is to aggregate a variety of news from RSS feeds, and render them in one place so they are easy to access and read. The initial phase of the app will be ‘seeded’ with pre-selected RSS feeds as a proof of concept. Further phases of app development will introduce additional functionality, including the capacity to login, save articles, and introduce user-selected RSS feeds.
